# Auction-using-Solidity-


Core idea:
Creating a smart contract which will include creating NFT token, carry out auction whose owner will 
be the art owner for selling the NFT at the highest bid and then reselling the NFT using same auction 
function whose owner will be the highest bidder of previous auction and transferring some amount 
to original artist of the NFT after selling and reselling the NFT.


For implementation on Remix platform, 
Compile the files in the below order,
1. NFT_creation.sol
2. Auction.sol
3. main.sol
After successfully compiling the codes then we need to deploy in the above order. 
Note: Environment – JavaScript VM 
Here is the link for remix which contains all the three files,
